You can also check the windows 7 useful links compendium: https://github.com/cyberhardt/windows7compendium.

Most software on this list are multi-platform, but there are some windows-only and linux-only programs as well. 

Most software on this list are open source, but there are some closed source ones as well. I tried to always put an open source alternative to closed source software.

Most software on this list are free, but there are some paid ones as well. I tried to always put a free alternative to a paid program.

video/media/mkv - v

-First Section - Players, Recorders, Editors-

1v - Best video player in general: https://mpv.io/ - o WU L M

2v - Home-theater/media-center/entertainment-hub: https://kodi.tv/ (Kodi) - o WU LU M A I
     ∟ This one can play menus. Replacement to VLC.

3v - Best ffmpeg-based video player, doubles down as lossless video cutter: https://github.com/aliakseis/FFmpegPlayer - o W?
     ∟ Pretty much a replacement to losslesscut, but with 1/30 (I've measured) of the RAM consumption. As a video player, it performs equal to if not better than mpv. Fantastic program.

4v - Foftware media menter (plex alternative): https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin - o W? LU M x

5v - Movie list: letterboxd.com - c

6v - Subtitles: https://www.opensubtitles.org - c

7v - Record and stream video: https://obsproject.com/ - o W LU M
     ∟ Last windows 7 compatible version: 28.1.2.

8v - Video editor: https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve - c W L M 
     ∟ Last windows 7 compatible version 7: 16.2.8.

9v - Video editor 2: https://kdenlive.org - o WU LU M x

10v - youtube-dlp: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp - o WU L M

11v - yt-dlp gui: https://github.com/Kannagi0303/yt-dlp-gui - o WU
      ∟ In order for it to work, install yt-dlp and ffmpeg. Put yt-dlp-gui.exe, yt-dlp.exe and ffmpeg.exe on the same directory (file). You can do this by extracting ffmpeg and putting the 2 yt dlp exes inside the bin folder. Don't modify the rest of the ffmpeg folder. Create a desktop shortcut of yt-dlp-gui.exe; then execute yt-dlp-gui and use it.
      Don't import chapters if you are going to download a section of a video - it will get corrupted.
      Make config files to download specific formats and resolutions: https://github.com/kannagi0303/yt-dlp-gui/discussions/106.

-Second Section - MKV and Encoding-

12v - ffmpeg: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds - o ?

13v - Edit mkv's: https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html - o W LU
      ∟ Last win7 compatible version: mkvtoolnix-64-bit-68.0.0-revision-036-g37903f25c (https://mkvtoolnix.download/windows/continuous/64-bit/68.0.0/), non-official qt5 builds: https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/405407-NON-OFFICIAL-Windows-builds-of-MKVtoolnix/page4#post2685373.

14v - gMKVExtract GUI: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmkvextractgui - o WU

15v - Cut and rejoin losslessly: https://sourceforge.net/projects/losslesscut.mirror/ - o W LU M
      ∟ Last windows 7 compatible version: 3.50.0.

16v - Edit subtitles: https://github.com/wangqr/Aegisub/ - o W? L M

17v - Encode, transcode media: https://handbrake.fr/ - o W LU M x
      ∟ Last win7 compatible version: 1.3.3.

18v - Another encoder: https://github.com/staxrip/staxrip - o W?

19v - Another encoder: https://ffmpeg-batch.sourceforge.io/ - o WU

20v - Doki Timing Guide: https://doki.co/support/doki-timing-guide/

21v - Good site & forum: https://www.videohelp.com/ 

-Third Section - CD/DVD/Blu-ray-

22v - Rip and decrypt disks: https://www.makemkv.com/ - c WU M x
      ∟ Linux version requires building. Beta keys: https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1053
      Mkv muxing isn't a necessity, you can just rip them as-is.

23v - Makemkv's ultimate uhd guide: https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19634
      ∟ Regarding that guide, most official UHD drives were purged from amazon and other sites. Most of the ones being sold were stripped from their ability to read and/or write uhd - the few models left that manage to do it are sold at outrageous prices. Pretty pathetic. I recommend LG or Pioneer internal drives. Don't buy USB/External ones. Try to get one with M-Disc support (most of them support m-disc). Use only single-layer blu ray for durability and reliability. Only buy disks made in either Japan or Singapore (preferably from Verbatim) - don't buy the ones made in Taiwan. Write in slowest speeds to guarantee reliable data write. Don't expose your disks and drives to heat, sun, humidity, vibration, dust.

24v - Burn disks (CD, DVD, BD): https://www.anyburn.com/ - c WU x
      ∟ Seems to be the best burner.

25v - Another one: https://www.imgburn.com/ - c WU

26v - Another one: https://www.fosshub.com/CDBurnerXP.html - c WU x

27v - On linux: https://apps.kde.org/k3b/ - o L x

ENDNOTE

I - This blog gave me the motivation I needed to do this list: digdeeper.neocities.org.

II - Privacy and freedom are about not being a product, not being abused by the government or corporations, not having your hardware slowed down by tracking, not being bombarded with directed ads, not being profiled, not being deceived by dark patterns. It is about having a satisfying, clean, honest experience on the sites you visit and on the programs you use.

III - Good programs have small memory footprints. That said, usability and intuitive interfaces are also of major importance. Whenever possible, I tried to select programs that had small memory footprints and were easy, intuitive, simple to use. This is also a reason why I try to avoid underperformant languages, and always seek to use either websites or native applications, instead of webapps.
