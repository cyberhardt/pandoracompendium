Description: This is a curated list of useful programs and websites, covering many different subjects, focused on simplicity, ease of use, privacy and freedom.

Unlike many similar projects that I've come across, this isn't merely a mindless list of programs related to certain subjects. In order to be featured on this list, a program needs to be useful, and better at what they do than the others, regarding the 4 aspects I've mentioned earlier: simplicity, ease of use, privacy and freedom. As the time passes, I'll make deeper and deeper searches on the web, and the list will get updated with less-known, but promising programs.

OBS: I'm currently re-working the compendium. Due to the sheer size of the .txt file, I opted for a new approach. I'll create one .txt for each subject. This will make it easier for me to work on it and for people to use it.

Also check out the Windows 7 Compendium: https://github.com/cyberhardt/windows7compendium

There is quite an amount of text, so I highly recommend you to download the .txt and open it on your desktop.

-

The compendium is divided into many categories and each entry has a some tags accompanying it, indicating whether it is open or closed source, and OS compatibility. Inside each category, similar entries are grouped together. Some categories are further divided into sections.

I do take suggestions, just leave them on the Issues tab (or make a PR) and I'll take a look.

I'll not post it directly on the readme, because the formatting would get all messed up if I did.
