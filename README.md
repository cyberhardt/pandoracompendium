Description: This is a curated list of useful programs and websites, covering many different subjects, focused on simplicity, ease of use, privacy and freedom.

Also check out the Windows 7 Compendium: https://github.com/cyberhardt/windows7compendium

There is quite an amount of text, so I highly recommend you to download the .txt and open it on your desktop.

The compendium is divided into many categories and each entry has a couple tags to accompany it, indicating whether it is open or closed source, and OS compatibility. Inside each category, similar entries are grouped together.

Most software on this list are multi-platform, but there are some windows-only and linux-only programs as well. 

Most software on this list are open source, but there are some closed source ones as well. I tried to always put an open source alternative to closed source software.

Most software on this list are free, but there are some paid ones as well. I tried to always put a free alternative to a paid program.
